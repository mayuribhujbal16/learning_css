                Korigad Fort, nestled near Lonavala in Maharashtra, is a scenic hill fort rising to about 923 meters above sea level. Itâ€™s a popular destination for trekkers, especially beginners, thanks to its relatively easy trail and breathtaking views. The fort holds historical significance as it was captured by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in 1657 and later seized by the British in 1818 after a dramatic siege. The trek to the top takes around an hour, winding through forested paths, stone steps, and lush greeneryâ€”particularly enchanting during the monsoon season when waterfalls and mist add a magical touch. At the summit, visitors are greeted by the Korai Devi temple, serene lakes, and ancient cannons, including the prominent Laxmi Toph. The fortâ€™s massive walls are still intact, allowing a full walk around its 2-kilometer perimeter with panoramic views of the surrounding Sahyadri ranges and the luxurious Aamby Valley below. Easily accessible from Lonavala via Peth Shahpur village, Korigad offers a perfect blend of history, nature, and adventure, making it a must-visit for anyone seeking a peaceful yet enriching escape.
